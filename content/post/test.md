Which programming language is the best one? What does that even mean? Here are
some potential angles to unwrap the question:

- popularity in terms of
  * end users
  * real users
  * hobbyist users
- a bucketlist of academic features
- a bucketlist of industrial features
- efficiency in terms of
  * runtime
  * space
  * development time
  * development space


# Popularity by end users

This is kinda easy.
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_languages_used_in_most_popular_websites)
says
JavaScript is used for essentially 100% of the websites out there as the
frontend language, giving it
easily the most end users.

If you ignore the frontend (because fuck javascript, right?), you get a mish mash of
Java, Go, C, C++, C#, Ruby, Python, JavaScript again, PHP and a few smaller
ones.

# Popularity by real users

By real users I mean people who mostly use the language to do actual things,
instead of just studying, talking or writing about the language. One should
expect this list to look pretty much like the previous one.


# Popularity by hobbyist users

Then we have the most dysfunctional group. The people who gobble up languages
like it was cocaine. This group refreshes r/programming a hundred times a day,
pausing only to refresh the Hacker News frontpage. We are easy to ridicule, but
perhaps we need help.

1) Rust
2) Go



# Academic features

Academic features make a programming language good or bad in an objective way.
Unfortunately, that objective way doesn't really matter in the real world, but
it still is the only way to get close to evidence that's sorta sciency.

1) Haskell
2) Idris
3) Rust


# Industrial features

The industry values practicality and cost efficiency. Or, it should do those
things, but it consistently fails to.

Companies care that a programming language is

- easy
- stable
- secure

This is because most companies want to get as much money as possible while
investing as little money as possible. Having a large amount of cheap workers available makes that
easier. 

1) Python
2) Java
3) C# (if you're stuck in **that** world)
4) JavaScript
5) PHP
6) Go


# Runtime efficiency

If we imagine an absurd world where every programmer is perfectly capable of
creating perfect programs in their language every time, it's easy to see which
programming language is the most efficient: your architecture's native machine
code.

Here in the so-called real world, people write inefficient C programs that are
beat by python programs with better libraries.



# Space efficiency

# Development time effeciency

# Development space effeciency
